		"description": "# Overview\nAsset Advisor South API allows customers to push data in Asset Advisor platform\n\n## Trial version\n\nThis API is a trial version available free of charge for selected customers and limited period.\n\n## API overview and usage\nThese API enables the following operations:\n\n**Measurements**\n- Push timeseries measurement values\n\n## How it works\nThis API works for any Schneider Electric customer who subscribe to this API and registered In Asset Advisor platform. The current version of the API is including the operations that are described below.\n\n### Measurements\nThis API enable to push timeseries value.\n\nThere are some constraints to respect:\n- Max size content to send is 500 kb\n- Timeseries sampling period must not be less than 10 min\n- We suggest a publication for a device between each 30 min and 120 min (standard is 60 min), but at least one publication for a device during the day  \n\n\n# Documentation\n\n## How to sign up\nThe current version of the API does not allow subscriptions on demand.\n\nSelected customers will be signed up manually, based on specific agreements with Schneider Electric, and will be able to access the API with the following information:\n\n**Step 1:** Receive the Exchange URL access for the API product.\n\n**Step 2:** [Register or login](https://exchange.se.com) with an Exchange account.\n\n**Step 3:** Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in the developer portal (API credentials and usage details are also available).\n\n\n# Catalog\nVariable catalog for each asset type\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Motor</summary>\n\n**Health**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- |\n| Motor_ElectricalHealth |  | 60 min| Health of the electric part of the motor(stator)\n| Motor_LoadHealth |  | 60 min| Health of the load (fan, pump, …)\n| Motor_ComponentHealth |  | 60 min| Health of the mechanical part of the motor (bearings, …)\n| Motor_ControlHealth |  | 60 min| Health of the devices controlling the motor (drive, soft-starter, …)\n| Motor_ProcessHealth |   | 60 min| Reports issues on the way the asset is operated (pump clogging, overload, …)\n| Motor_ShaftTrainHealth |   | 60 min| Health of the shaft train (unbalance, misalignement, …)\n| Motor_TransmissionHealth |   | 60 min| Health of the transmission (gearbox, belt, …)\n\n**Condition monitoring**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- |\n| Motor_StatorTemperature1 |°C| 15 min| Temperature measured inside the stator windings\n| Motor_StatorTemperature2 |°C| 15 min| Temperature measured inside the stator windings\n| Motor_StatorTemperature3 |°C| 15 min| Temperature measured inside the stator windings\n| Motor_BearingTemperature1 |°C| 15 min| \n| Motor_BearingTemperature2 |°C| 15 min| \n\n**Operating conditions**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- |\n| CMOT1_Spd |Hz| 5 min| Motor shaft rotation speed\n| CMOT1_TorqueLevCoef |Ratio| 5 min| Motor torque as a ratio of the rated torque of the motor\n| CMOT1_NbStartTtl |  | 24 h| \n| OpTime |s| 24 h| Operating time of the motor\n\n**Electrical measurements**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- | \n| I |A| 5 min| Average of the 3 RMS currents\n| VLLAvg |V| 5 min| Average of the 3 RMS phase to phase voltages\n| VLNAvg |V| 5 min| Average of the 3 RMS phase to neutral voltages\n| PFTtl |Ratio| 5 min| Total power factor on the 3 phases\n| WTtl |W| 5 min| Total active power on the 3 phases\n| VARTtl |VAr| 5 min| Total reactive power on the 3 phases\n| Hz |Hz| 5 min| Frequency of the supply voltage applied to the motor\n| WHr |Wh| 24 h| Cumulated active energy consumed by the motor\n| VARHr |VARHr| 24 h| Cumulated reactive energy consumed by the motor\n\n**Environment**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- |\n| T_ambient |°C| 15 min| Ambient temperature in the place where the motor operates\n| THUM1_RelHumAmbient |Ratio| 15 min| Ambient relative humidity\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Transformator</summary>\n\n**Usage**\n| Identifier | Unit | Max Sampling <br> Period | Description |\n| ---------- | ---- | -----------------------: |----------------------------------------------------- |\n|MoistureContent|%| -
